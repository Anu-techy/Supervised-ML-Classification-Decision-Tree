# Supervised-ML-Classification-Decision-Tree

A decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It works by splitting data into subsets based on the value of input features.
These splits form a tree-like structure, hence the name.

The root node is selected based on a splitting criterion, which evaluates how "good" a feature is at splitting the data. 
The most common criteria are:

1. Gini impurity
2. Information Gain (Entropy) 


✅ Pros

Easy to understand and interpret

No need for feature scaling

Handles both numerical and categorical data

❌ Cons

Can overfit the data if not pruned

Unstable with small data changes

Greedy algorithm (locally optimal splits may not be globally optimal)
